# TODO

Working backlog for improving Alfred. Dev-facing — like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this
file is **not** auto-loaded into Alfred's runtime prompt.

Items graduate: **Now** → branch + PR (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`) → strike through
and move to **Done** with the PR number. Anything with a GitHub issue links to it.

---

## Now

- [ ] **Scrub `USER.md` from git history.** The restructure stopped *future*
      commits of personal data, but the initial commit still contains a real
      name and timezone, and the repo is on GitHub. Needs a `git filter-repo`
      pass + force-push, or accept it and move on — a deliberate call, not a
      silent one.

## Next

- [ ] **Tiered memory (L1/L2).** `agent/var/memories/MEMORY.md` is injected into
      every new session; it's empty today, but the split plan is already noted in
      that file's header (issue #8). Do it when size actually becomes a problem.

## Someday / Maybe

- [ ] **Proactive auth health check.** Auth lapses are now caught on the turn
      they happen (#20), but not before. A probe on boot was deliberately
      skipped: it would run inside the launcher's restart loop. A once-daily
      check, or one after a long idle gap, would catch it sooner.

- [ ] **Prune `agent/var/logs/` and `agent/var/memories/dailies/`.** Both grow
      without bound.
- [ ] **A task/todo store for Alfred himself** — a persistent list he can read
      and append to across sessions, plus rules in `agent/SOUL.md` for when to
      add and complete items. (Distinct from *this* file, which is for the repo.)
- [ ] **Sanity-check script.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` describes pre-PR checks but
      there's no test or lint entrypoint in `package.json`. The fresh-clone
      bootstrap path is the obvious first thing worth a real test.
- [ ] **Attachment tokens with no file extension** get named `attachment_0` with
      no suffix; Discord may not preview them.

## Done

- [x] **Stopped the crash loop and capped the log.** An unhandled `EAI_AGAIN`
      from `client.login()` meant a network outage restarted the bot every 5s
      forever — 383,295 restarts in 34 days, and the real reason `alfred.log`
      reached 186 MB. Added a caught login rejection, DNS re-check and
      exponential backoff in the launcher, and log rotation. (#22)
- [x] **Auth lapses and timeouts are reported as failures**, not relayed as
      things Alfred said. (#20)
- [x] **Serialized turns and gave `state.json` a single writer** — concurrent
      messages raced on session state, and `dream.sh` clobbered it
      mid-conversation. (#18)
- [x] **Split the repo into three layers** — app / `agent/` config / `agent/var/`
      state, so dev files and Alfred's runtime files stop sharing a namespace.
      Fixed the two leaks it was hiding: personal files tracked in git, and
      `memories/dailies/` neither tracked nor ignored. (v2.0.0)
